> This comprehensive penetration testing report details the in-depth security assessment performed against the target system at 192.168.1.10. The assessment combined network discovery, service fingerprinting, vulnerability scans, exploitation techniques, brute force credential testing, injection analysis, and post-exploitation processes to uncover multiple vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Key findings include outdated server versions (notably Apache 2.4.29), directory indexing misconfigurations, misconfigured SSL certificates, successful exploitation of known backdoors, critical flaws such as BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) on RDP, SQL injection vulnerabilities, successful credential brute forcing, and evidence of lateral movement culminating in full system compromise via a kernel exploit (CVE-2020-1234). Quantitative analysis identified various issues ranging from Critical to Low severity. The assessment has revealed risks that could allow unauthorized access, data breaches, and persistent system control if not remediated promptly. Detailed exploitation logs, evidence collections, and step-by-step remediation guidelines are provided herein to support immediate corrective actions.

The following section delineates the scope and objectives of this penetration testing engagement:

The assessment covered a network endpoint at IP address 192.168.1.10, including its exposed services such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, FTP, and RDP. Additional targets included the web application endpoints and wireless infrastructure (CorporateWiFi). The primary objectives were vulnerability identification, exploitation for validation of threats, risk evaluation, and formulation of effective remediation recommendations. Limitations were primarily confined to externally facing services and publicly accessible network segments, with internal system configurations evaluated solely through remote exploitation techniques.

---


The assessment was conducted using a systematic and comprehensive approach that encompasses reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and validation:

The testing process followed a systematic phased approach starting with passive and active reconnaissance via network scanning (using SYN scans) and service fingerprinting. This was followed by vulnerability assessment using web server scanning, vulnerability management tools, and brute force attacks. Subsequent controlled exploitation techniques were applied to verify vulnerabilities, including targeted exploitation modules for known software weaknesses. The procedure incorporated data gathering, vulnerability confirmation, exploitation, post-exploitation analysis, and evidence documentation. All methods adhere to industry-standard penetration testing best practices ensuring repeatability and technical precision in every step.

> The identified vulnerabilities present considerable risks ranging from remote code execution and unauthorized access to data exfiltration and full system compromise. The high and critical vulnerabilities, particularly related to brute force attacks, kernel exploits, outdated services, and SQL injection paths, increase the likelihood of severe operational disruption and unauthorized data access. Quantitative data from exploitation activities accentuates the need for immediate remediation measures to mitigate these risks.

---


> A multi-layered remediation plan is recommended: firstly, update all outdated software and apply critical patches, especially for Apache, kernel, and RDP services. Secondly, implement strong authentication mechanisms along with account lockouts and multifactor authentication on SSH and web services. Thirdly, reconfigure web server settings by disabling directory indexing and correcting SSL configurations. Fourth, sanitize all web application inputs to mitigate SQL injection risks. Finally, secure wireless networks by disabling WPS and enforcing robust encryption. Continuous monitoring and periodic vulnerability assessments are advised for ongoing security posture maintenance.
